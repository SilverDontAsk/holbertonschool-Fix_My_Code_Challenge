""" FizzBuzz
The issue with this code was in the order the process of
fizzbuzzing.
Instead of having it be first searching for what to
fizz, we must first search for what to fizzbuzz
as if we fizz first it'll lead to issues where
numbers that are fizzbuzz turn into fizz. Same would go
for if buzz was put as the first if statement.
